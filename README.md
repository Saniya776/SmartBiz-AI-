SmartBiz AI – Multi-Agent Business Reasoning System (Prototype):

SmartBiz AI is an experimental multi-agent system designed to simulate small-business workflows such as data analysis, basic decision-making, task coordination, and insight generation.
This prototype was built as a 3-day learning experiment using Google AI Studio and Kaggle.

This is not the final app — just the demo version.
A full Streamlit web app + UI/UX will be added soon.

🚀 Project Overview:

SmartBiz AI is designed to act like a tiny digital enterprise by:

Analyzing datasets

Generating insights

Coordinating tasks between agents

Handling workflows

Supporting simple decision-making

Maintaining memory + context

The system uses an orchestrator-based agent architecture to route tasks intelligently.

Key Features:

Multi-Agent Orchestrator
Manages flow, memory, and task routing.

Data Analysis Agent
Performs dataset interpretation and basic EDA.

Reasoning Agent
Simulates business logic and decision flows.

Task Automation Agent
Handles smaller tasks and operations.

Context + Memory System
Preserves important information between steps.

Google AI Studio Demo Integration
Allows users to test the prototype quickly.

A cleaned professional version is included in this repo.



How It Works:
1. Orchestrator (Brain)

Central controller that calls agents, manages state, and compiles outputs.

2. Data Agent

Handles dataset reading, cleaning, and producing structured insights.

3. Reasoning Agent

Simulates business-style logic, decisions, and basic strategy suggestions.

4. Task Agent

Executes supporting workflow tasks.

5. Memory Module

Stores context to maintain decision flow and coherence.

Future Roadmap:

Build full Streamlit web application

Add modern UI/UX

Expand reasoning depth

Addition of advanced analytics (regression, ML insights)

Enable file uploads

Deploy as an API service
