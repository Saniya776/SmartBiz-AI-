SmartBiz AI – Multi-Agent Business Reasoning System (Prototype)

SmartBiz AI is an experimental multi-agent system designed to simulate small-business workflows such as data analysis, basic decision-making, task coordination, and insight generation.
This prototype was built as a 3-day learning experiment using Google AI Studio and Kaggle.

This is not the final app — just the demo version.
A full Streamlit web app + UI/UX will be added soon.

🚀 Project Overview

SmartBiz AI is designed to act like a tiny digital enterprise by:

Analyzing datasets

Generating insights

Coordinating tasks between agents

Handling workflows

Supporting simple decision-making

Maintaining memory + context

The system uses an orchestrator-based agent architecture to route tasks intelligently.
